# Now

This is what I’m focused on right now. It changes as life does.

*Updated on October 17th, 2025 from Madrid, Spain.*

## Personal

Struggling to find a balance between family, work and myself. Improving step by step, but there's still a long way to go. For this I'm using [Habitica](https://habitica.com/) to keep track of progress.

## Reading

Reading and enjoying Stone Junction by Jim Dodge. An unconventional and exquisite mix of magic, outlaws, and philosophy

## Listening

In summer I got a [FIIO DM13](https://www.fiio.com/dm13) CD player and I've been using it a lot. I love the feeling of getting a CD out of the box,  putting it in the player and listen to it. While the artwork is not as nice as on vinyls, for me CDs hit a sweet spot between the enjoyment and convenience.

The albums that I'm playing more at the moment are:

- [Choke_Enough by Oklou](https://oklou.bandcamp.com/album/choke-enough)  
- [Dreamstate by Kelly Lee Owens](https://kellyleeowens.bandcamp.com/album/dreamstate)
- [Veronica Electronica by Madonna](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Veronica_Electronica)

## Tech

Setting up the [minilab](https://minilab.co) as a way to recover some of the lost freedom in the internet. Also switched to Panic's [Nova](https://nova.app/) editor.
