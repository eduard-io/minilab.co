# Minilab

_A quiet place_

A small site to share ideas, notes and experiments by [Eduard Gim√©nez](https://eduard.io). Searching for the DIY spirit in a dead internet.

The minilab is always under construction.

## Colophon

The minilab is built by hand on [Nova](https://nova.app), using [new.css](https://newcss.net/usage), [Inter](https://rsms.me/inter/) and, [11ty](https://www.11ty.dev) to build the site.

Hosted on [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com).
