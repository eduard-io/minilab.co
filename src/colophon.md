# Colophon

The minilab is a static site built using [11ty](https://www.11ty.dev) and hosted
on [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com). It's built by hand with
[Nova](https://nova.app) with some minor assistance from AI. You can check the
source in [Github](https://github.com/eduar-io/minilab.co).

It uses [umami](https://umami.is) for privacy conscious tracking.

On the aesthetic side, it uses a customized version of
[new.css](https://newcss.net/usage) and the font is
[Inter](https://rsms.me/inter/).
